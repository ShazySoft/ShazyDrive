ShazyDrive is a project by ShazySoft that aims to make a lightweight, simple, yet highly configurable game engine with as few moving parts as possible; currently the only component it uses that's external to C++ is SDL. Some of its key features include a configurable spatial hashing collision system, a highly customizable background engine including support for parallax scrolling and dither easing, multiple window support and awareness, sprite depth and layering and a bunch of other stuff I'm forgetting about, surely! I did my best to label and document everything in the code, but further documentation will be coming soon!

My work on this engine is open-source, so if you find it or any component of it useful then feel free to use it! That being said, I'm a busy, starving, and near-invisible indie shop, so if you were to throw in some credit to ShazySoft and let me know about your project it would be super appreciated! Or, if you find some way to make anything better (goodness knows, there's plenty of room for that) I'd appreciate constructive criticism! Either way, I can be reached at shazysoft@gmail.com
 
 All the code in the headers and main.cpp is written by me! That being said, special thanks to LazyFoo for his super useful SDL tutorials.
